This is a simple Ansible playbook to be used in conjunction with openstack-ansible (OSA). There is a current limitation with OSA preventing service policy overrides from being correctly pushed to Horizon containers and this playbook addresses this.

REQUIREMENTS:

OpenStack-Ansible (https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible)
